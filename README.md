## Summary

Toqcidad√£o is a free mobile app that allows all citizens to report issues instantly, directly to local authorities or service providers.

Its main goal is to make citizens‚Äô lives easier, by straight forwarding the communication of most issues found in their neighbourhood so they can be solved, hassle-free and in a timely manner, by the right authorities.

I developed this project with Juan de la Cruz, Marta Casal, Tiago Lu√≠s and Tiago Rodrigues for a User Experience Design class. The end goal of the project was delivering an MVP prototype of our idea and testing it with real users throughout the semester.

I took part in every design stage, from research to interaction design and testing, but was solely responsible for the final mockups and prototyping.

**Our Vision**</br>
Foster the community spirit by making everybody responsible for solving issues in their neighbourhood;</br>
Cultivate a sense of civic responsibility.

**Our Mission**</br>
Offer an easier way for citizens to report most issues found outside in any city;</br>
Improve the Portuguese public places.

## Problem

People often have a hard time when trying to report issues they come across in their local community.

Not knowing which authority handles the specific issue, filling out long bureaucratic forms and not getting any feedback that the issue is being taken care of, can discourage even the most patient citizen from fulfilling its civic duties.

## Proposed Solution

With Toqcidad√£o reporting an issue is as simple as taking a photo, filling in some details about the problem and sending the report with the issue‚Äôs location. The reported issue is automatically delivered to the appropriate authority in that area.

By categorizing issue types and handing them over to the relevant authority based on the incident‚Äôs location, reporting with Toqcidad√£o is quick, simple and hassle-free.

Toqcidad√£o is a straightforward, pain-free way of reporting local issues that gives citizens the satisfaction of contributing to getting problems fixed in their neighbourhood.

It‚Äôs also beneficial for authorities, councils and service providers, as it reduces the costs of large customer service units and call centres in urban management systems.

With Toqcidad√£o citizens can:

* Report an issue accurately, wherever they are;
* Automatically send the issue report to the right authority;
* Save a draft of the report if service is unavailable and send it later;
* Keep updated on their reports‚Äô status;
* Check their past reports;
* View reported issues in the neighbourhood;
* Follow issues reported by other citizens;
* Comment and add photos to other citizen‚Äôs issues and their own;
* Setup a nickname to protect their identity from other citizens;
* Share issues on social media and email.

Toqcidad√£o lets citizens report a large number of issues like:

* Litter
* Street Cleaning
* Graffiti
* Roadblocks
* Abusive parking
* Pavement and road damage
* Broken street signs
* Broken playgrounds
* Street lighting issues
* Broken pipes

‚Ä¶ And much more. We‚Äôll expand the covered issues and improve categorization as we go.

## Step 1 ‚Äî Research

<p align="center">

SWOT Analysis.
</p>

We kicked-off research by conducting a [SWOT analysis on 3 competing products](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/tree/master/_docs_readme/swot):

* [FixCascais](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/swot/swot_fixcascais.jpg) (Cascais/Portugal) ‚Äî an app from the Cascais Municipal Council where each citizen, resident or visitor, can help the Chamber improve its territory, by reporting different issues that can be found in public spaces;
* [Barrios Activos](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/swot/swot_barrios-activos.jpg) (Spain) ‚Äî an online community (app and website) where neighbours can upload and support reports to wage solutions to the problems in their local area;
* [Snap Send Solve](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/swot/swot_snap-send-solve.jpg) (Australia and New Zealand) ‚Äî an app that allows citizens to report issues to their council or local authorities.

Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs SWOT Analysis.
</p>

Assessing the competition helped us understand these products‚Äô pain-points and strengths, as well as explore new ideas, figure out how we can enter the market and find focus.

Doing a SWOT analysis helped us distil good ideas for features and ways of organizing our app that could work for our product design solution.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_script.jpg" alt="Online Survey" width="1000">
Online Survey.
</p>

We did interviews and online surveys to assess:

* if our idea for this digital product could be useful;
* if people already report issues they find in public spaces;
* how they do it;
* what are the pain-points;
* what type of issues they report;
* what are the most common issues they find;
* if they don‚Äôt report, why;
* among other‚Ä¶

We worked on a [set of questions](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/survey_questions.jpg) that could help us reach our goals and sent out the survey via Google Forms.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_answers.jpg" alt="Surveys‚Äô Answers" width="1000">
<a href="https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/survey_answers_complete.jpg">Surveys‚Äô Answers</a>.
</p>

We distilled the most common answers from **90+ responses** and followed-up with some target participants via in-person interviews.

We discovered that 71% of our online participants don‚Äôt report incidents, mainly because they don‚Äôt know where to send the report (‚âà 57%), the process is too long and tiresome, they never get feedback on the report and there‚Äôs no easy way to do it.

Less bureaucracy, ease and speed, as well as a way that could facilitate the report of several issues to various authorities could make these people start reporting.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_graph-01.jpg" alt="Distribution of people who report incidents by age" width="1000">
Most people who report incidents are over 45.
</p>

Those who already report incidents do it immediately, by email or phone, but more than half find it hard because knowing who‚Äôs the appropriate authority is tricky and the reporting process is over-complicated.

Getting feedback is also an issue. Approximately 82% of our inquirers that report incidents admitted that they never got feedback on any issue they reported, which can be frustrating. 96% believe feedback is very important so that they know they are making a difference.

The most common incidents people find on the street are litter, construction work, pavement damage, abusive parking and accessibility issues.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_graph-02.jpg" alt="Connection between reporting incidents and having kids" width="1000">
Apparently, people who have kids report issues more often than those who don‚Äôt.
</p>

There might also be a connection between having kids and reporting incidents. Maybe because people who have kids develop a sharper sense of civic duty as they‚Äôre taking care of something they‚Äôll be leaving to their children.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/interviews-quotes.jpg" alt="Interviews‚Äô quotes" width="1000">
Interviews‚Äô quotes.
</p>

The [follow-up interviews](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/entrevistas.pdf) ratified our survey insights. Most interviewees don‚Äôt know where to send their reports; they always have to look up online.

They said they‚Äôd be more proactive if there was a simpler way to report issues and that being able to check incidents in their surroundings, see if things are getting fixed and give their support would also make a big difference.

In fact, ‚âà 92% of our online survey inquirers also said they‚Äôd like to know of issues reported nearby.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/incidents.jpg" alt="Incidents List" width="1000">
Incidents List.
</p>

The interviews and online surveys also helped us categorize the incident types to include in the MVP.

We did an ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù list of incidents with every issue we could think of and individually tried to assign a category name to each one. We got to the category set by comparing results and making tests with 10 potential users using Optimal Workshop online tree testing.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/tree-testing.jpg" alt="Tree Testing" width="1000">
Tree Testing results.
</p>

The tree testing showed us that some incidents can be dubious and hard to categorize. So for the MVP, we decided that the categories screen should include a link to a help screen.

## Step 2 ‚Äî Storyboarding

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/storyboard.jpg" alt="Storyboard depicting Joana‚Äôs journey." width="1000">
Storyboard depicting the user‚Äôs journey.
</p>

> Joana, a mother of two, goes with her children to the playground. Her kids are sad because a swing is broken. Joana picks up her mobile phone and uses Toqcidad√£o to report the issue. She chooses a category for the incident, describes the problem, adds a photo, checks the location and hits send. The report is delivered to the relevant authority who sends technicians to repair the broken swing. Joana receives a notification when the issue is fixed and goes back to the park where her children can now play safely.

After analysing the results from the interviews and surveys, we storyboarded the user‚Äôs journey (scenario).

Our goal was to capture the problem and the solution instead of starting with the design of the screens.

This storyboard helped us ensure the whole team was on the same page about the problem our product solved.

## Step 3 ‚Äî Proto-Persona

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/proto-persona.jpg" alt="Proto-persona scheme" width="1000">
Meet Joana, our proto-persona.
</p>

The interviews, surveys and storyboard naturally allowed us to establish a key character to represent who will use the product. This way, we were able to design for a specific somebody instead of a generic anybody.

The proto-persona helped us foster empathy for the user and stay focused on people instead of features so we could design a solution that would solve specific problems for a precise type of user.

## Step 4 ‚Äî User Flow

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/user-flow.jpg" alt="Main user flow detail" width="1000">
Reporting an Issue (detail).
</p>

Mapping out the [key user flow](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/user-flow_reportar-ocorrencia.jpg) early helped us avoid spending too much time redesigning and revising wireframes.

The user flow also helped the team scope the product and understand the key tech dependencies.

## Step 5 ‚Äî Information Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/info-arch.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs Information Architecture" width="1000">
Information Architecture detail.
</p>

Before diving into the wireframes, we mapped out the high-level [information architecture](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/arquitectura-info.jpg) to make sure the whole team was on board about the app‚Äôs structure.

## Step 6 ‚Äî Sketching and Wireframing

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/sketches.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs sketches" width="1000">
First Sketches.
</p>

After identifying the key user flow and information architecture, we did some rough sketching and worked on low-fidelity wireframes to quickly generate ideas on how the main screens could fit together and figure out the details of the interface elements.

Applying lean UX, our team sketched wireframes to readily test, validate, and move on to digital wireframes.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/wireframes_01.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs wireframes" width="1000">
Wireframes.
</p>

Each team member worked on their own wireframes using Balsamiq Mockups. We then revised every proposal and picked the best ideas and solutions that came up.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/wireframes_02.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs wireframes" width="1000">
Wireframes.
</p>

We settled on a linear navigation for the incident report, that progressively asks for the user‚Äôs input, in 4 easy steps:

* Pick a category;
* Describe the incident;
* Add a photo (optional; up to 4);
* Set the incident‚Äôs location (automatically filled-in by the device‚Äôs GPS but can be changed, as the user might want to submit an incident later);
* Revise and report;

All screens from the report user flow have a top bar showing the user‚Äôs progress and the number of steps until completion. The progress bar also serves as a navigation that enables the user to go back and fix any mistakes he might have done while filling-in the report‚Äôs details.
