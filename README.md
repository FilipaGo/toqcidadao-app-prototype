## Summary

ToqcidadÃ£o is a free mobile app that allows all citizens to report issues instantly, directly to local authorities or service providers.

Itsâ€™ main goal is to make citizensâ€™ lives easier, by straight forwarding the communication of most issues found in their neighbourhood, so that they can be solved, hassle-free and in a timely manner, by the right authorities.

This project was developed with Juan de la Cruz, Marta Casal, Tiago LuÃ­s and Tiago Rodrigues for a User Experience Design class. The end goal of the project for this class was delivering an MVP prototype of our idea and testing it with real users throughout the semester.

I took part in every design stage, from research to interaction design and testing, but was sole responsible for the final mockups and prototyping.

**Our Vision**</br>
Foster the community spirit by making everybody responsible for solving issues in their neighbourhood;</br>
Cultivate a sense of civic responsibility.

**Our Mission**</br>
Offer an easier way for citizens to report most issues found outside in any city;</br>
Improve the Portuguese public places.
