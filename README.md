## Summary

ToqcidadÃ£o is a free mobile app that allows all citizens to report issues instantly, directly to local authorities or service providers.

Itsâ€™ main goal is to make citizensâ€™ lives easier, by straight forwarding the communication of most issues found in their neighbourhood, so that they can be solved, hassle-free and in a timely manner, by the right authorities.

This project was developed with Juan de la Cruz, Marta Casal, Tiago LuÃ­s and Tiago Rodrigues for a User Experience Design class. The end goal of the project for this class was delivering an MVP prototype of our idea and testing it with real users throughout the semester.

I took part in every design stage, from research to interaction design and testing, but was sole responsible for the final mockups and prototyping.

**Our Vision**</br>
Foster the community spirit by making everybody responsible for solving issues in their neighbourhood;</br>
Cultivate a sense of civic responsibility.

**Our Mission**</br>
Offer an easier way for citizens to report most issues found outside in any city;</br>
Improve the Portuguese public places.

## Problem

People often have a hard time when trying to report issues they come across in their local community.

Not knowing which authority is responsible for the specific issue, filling out long bureaucratic forms and not getting any feedback that the issue is being taken care of, can discourage even the most patient citizen from fulfilling itsâ€™ civic duties.

## Proposed Solution

With ToqcidadÃ£o reporting an issue is as simple as taking a photo, filling-in some details about the problem and sending the report with the issueâ€™s location. The reported issue is automatically delivered to the appropriate authority in that area.

By categorizing issue types and handing them over to the relevant authority based on the incidentâ€™s location, reporting issues with ToqcidadÃ£o is quick, simple and hassle-free.

ToqcidadÃ£o is a straightforward, pain-free way of reporting local issues that gives citizens the satisfaction of contributing to getting problems fixed in their neighbourhood.

Itâ€™s also beneficial for authorities, councils and service providers, as it reduces the costs of large customer service units and call centres in urban management systems.

With ToqcidadÃ£o citizens can:

* Report an issue accurately, wherever they are;
* Automatically send the issue report to the right authority;
* Save a draft of the report if service is unavailable, and send it later;
* Keep updated on their reportsâ€™ status;
* Check their past reports;
* View reported issues in the neighbourhood;
* Follow issues reported by other citizens;
* Comment and add photos to other citizenâ€™s issues and their own;
* Setup a nickname to protect their identity from other citizens;
* Share issues on social media and email.

ToqcidadÃ£o lets citizens report a large amount of issues like:

* Litter
* Street Cleaning
* Graffiti
* Roadblocks
* Abusive parking
* Pavement and road damage
* Broken street signs
* Broken playgrounds
* Street lighting issues
* Broken pipes

â€¦And much more. Weâ€™ll expand the covered issues and improve categorization as we go.
