## Summary

Toqcidad√£o is a free mobile app that allows all citizens to **report issues instantly, directly to local authorities or service providers**.

Its main goal is to make citizens‚Äô lives easier, by straight forwarding the communication of most issues found in their neighbourhood so they can be solved, hassle-free and in a timely manner, by the right authorities.

I developed this project with Juan de la Cruz, Marta Casal, Tiago Lu√≠s and Tiago Rodrigues for a User Experience Design class. The end goal of the project was delivering an MVP prototype of our idea and testing it with real users throughout the semester.

I took part in every design stage, from research to interaction design and testing, but was solely responsible for the final mockups and prototyping.

**Our Vision**</br>
Foster the community spirit by making everybody responsible for solving issues in their neighbourhood;</br>
Cultivate a sense of civic responsibility.

**Our Mission**</br>
Offer an easier way for citizens to report most issues found outside in any city;</br>
Improve the Portuguese public places.

## Problem

People often have a hard time when trying to report issues they come across in their local community.

Not knowing which authority handles the specific issue, filling out long bureaucratic forms and not getting any feedback that the issue is being taken care of, can discourage even the most patient citizen from fulfilling its civic duties.

## Proposed Solution

With Toqcidad√£o **reporting an issue is as simple as taking a photo, filling in some details about the problem and sending the report with the issue‚Äôs location.** The reported issue is automatically delivered to the appropriate authority in that area.

By categorizing issue types and handing them over to the relevant authority based on the incident‚Äôs location, reporting with Toqcidad√£o is quick, simple and hassle-free.

Toqcidad√£o is a straightforward, pain-free way of reporting local issues that gives citizens the satisfaction of contributing to getting problems fixed in their neighbourhood.

It‚Äôs also beneficial for authorities, councils and service providers, as it reduces the costs of large customer service units and call centres in urban management systems.

**With Toqcidad√£o citizens can:**

* Report an issue accurately, wherever they are;
* Automatically send the issue report to the right authority;
* Save a draft of the report if service is unavailable and send it later;
* Keep updated on their reports‚Äô status;
* Check their past reports;
* View reported issues in the neighbourhood;
* Follow issues reported by other citizens;
* Comment and add photos to other citizen‚Äôs issues and their own;
* Setup a nickname to protect their identity from other citizens;
* Share issues on social media and email.

**Toqcidad√£o lets citizens report a large number of issues like:**

* Litter
* Street Cleaning
* Graffiti
* Roadblocks
* Abusive parking
* Pavement and road damage
* Broken street signs
* Broken playgrounds
* Street lighting issues
* Broken pipes

‚Ä¶ And much more. We‚Äôll expand the covered issues and improve categorization as we go.

## Step 1 ‚Äî Research

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/swot.jpg" alt="SWOT" width="1000">
SWOT Analysis.
</p>

We kicked-off research by conducting a [SWOT analysis on 3 competing products](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/tree/master/_docs_readme/swot):

* [FixCascais](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/swot/swot_fixcascais.jpg) (Cascais/Portugal) ‚Äî an app from the Cascais Municipal Council where each citizen, resident or visitor, can help the Chamber improve its territory, by reporting different issues that can be found in public spaces;
* [Barrios Activos](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/swot/swot_barrios-activos.jpg) (Spain) ‚Äî an online community (app and website) where neighbours can upload and support reports to wage solutions to the problems in their local area;
* [Snap Send Solve](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/swot/swot_snap-send-solve.jpg) (Australia and New Zealand) ‚Äî an app that allows citizens to report issues to their council or local authorities.

<p align="center">

Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs SWOT Analysis.
</p>

**Assessing the competition helped us understand these products‚Äô pain-points and strengths, as well as explore new ideas, figure out how we can enter the market and find focus.**

Doing a SWOT analysis helped us distil good ideas for features and ways of organizing our app that could work for our product design solution.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_script.jpg" alt="Online Survey" width="1000">
Online Survey.
</p>

**We did interviews and online surveys to assess:**

* if our idea for this digital product could be useful;
* if people already report issues they find in public spaces;
* how they do it;
* what are the pain-points;
* what type of issues they report;
* what are the most common issues they find;
* if they don‚Äôt report, why;
* among other‚Ä¶

We worked on a [set of questions](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/survey_questions.jpg) that could help us reach our goals and sent out the survey via Google Forms.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_answers.jpg" alt="Surveys‚Äô Answers" width="1000">
<a href="https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/survey_answers_complete.jpg">Surveys‚Äô Answers</a>.
</p>

We distilled the most common answers from **90+ responses** and followed-up with some target participants via in-person interviews.

We discovered that **71% of our online participants don‚Äôt report incidents**, mainly because they don‚Äôt know where to send the report (‚âà 57%), the process is too long and tiresome, they never get feedback on the report and there‚Äôs no easy way to do it.

**Less bureaucracy, ease and speed, as well as a way that could facilitate the report of several issues to various authorities could make these people start reporting.**

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_graph-01.jpg" alt="Distribution of people who report incidents by age" width="1000">
Most people who report incidents are over 45.
</p>

Those who already report incidents do it immediately, by email or phone, but more than half find it hard because knowing who‚Äôs the appropriate authority is tricky and the reporting process is over-complicated.

Getting feedback is also an issue. **Approximately 82% of our inquirers that report incidents admitted that they never got feedback on any issue they reported, which can be frustrating.** 96% believe feedback is very important so that they know they are making a difference.

The most common incidents people find on the street are litter, construction work, pavement damage, abusive parking and accessibility issues.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/survey_graph-02.jpg" alt="Connection between reporting incidents and having kids" width="1000">
Apparently, people who have kids report issues more often than those who don‚Äôt.
</p>

There might also be a connection between having kids and reporting incidents. Maybe because people who have kids develop a sharper sense of civic duty as they‚Äôre taking care of something they‚Äôll be leaving to their children.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/interviews-quotes_eng.jpg" alt="Interviews‚Äô quotes" width="1000">
Interviews‚Äô quotes.
</p>

**The [follow-up interviews](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/entrevistas.pdf) ratified our survey insights.** Most interviewees don‚Äôt know where to send their reports; they always have to look up online.

They said they‚Äôd be more proactive if there was a simpler way to report issues and that being able to check incidents in their surroundings, see if things are getting fixed and give their support would also make a big difference.

In fact, ‚âà 92% of our online survey inquirers also said they‚Äôd like to know of issues reported nearby.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/incidents.jpg" alt="Incidents List" width="1000">
Incidents List.
</p>

**The interviews and online surveys also helped us categorize the incident types to include in the MVP.**

We did an ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù list of incidents with every issue we could think of and individually tried to assign a category name to each one. We got to the category set by comparing results and making tests with 10 potential users using Optimal Workshop online tree testing.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/tree-testing.jpg" alt="Tree Testing" width="1000">
Tree Testing results.
</p>

The tree testing showed us that some incidents can be dubious and hard to categorize. So for the MVP, we decided that the categories screen should include a link to a help screen.

## Step 2 ‚Äî Storyboarding

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/storyboard.jpg" alt="Storyboard depicting Joana‚Äôs journey." width="1000">
Storyboard depicting the user‚Äôs journey.
</p>

> Joana, a mother of two, goes with her children to the playground. Her kids are sad because a swing is broken. Joana picks up her mobile phone and uses Toqcidad√£o to report the issue. She chooses a category for the incident, describes the problem, adds a photo, checks the location and hits send. The report is delivered to the relevant authority who sends technicians to repair the broken swing. Joana receives a notification when the issue is fixed and goes back to the park where her children can now play safely.

After analysing the results from the interviews and surveys, we storyboarded the user‚Äôs journey (scenario).

Our goal was to **capture the problem and the solution** instead of starting with the design of the screens.

This storyboard helped us ensure the whole team was on the same page about the problem our product solved.

## Step 3 ‚Äî Proto-Persona

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/proto-persona.jpg" alt="Proto-persona scheme" width="1000">
Meet Joana, our proto-persona.
</p>

The interviews, surveys and storyboard naturally allowed us to establish a key character to represent who will use the product. This way, we were able to design for a specific somebody instead of a generic anybody.

The proto-persona helped us foster empathy for the user and **stay focused on people instead of features** so we could design a solution that would solve specific problems for a precise type of user.

## Step 4 ‚Äî User Flow

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/user-flow.jpg" alt="Main user flow detail" width="1000">
Reporting an Issue (detail).
</p>

Mapping out the [key user flow](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/user-flow_reportar-ocorrencia.jpg) early helped us avoid spending too much time redesigning and revising wireframes.

The user flow also helped the team **scope the product and understand the key tech dependencies.**

## Step 5 ‚Äî Information Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/info-arch.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs Information Architecture" width="1000">
Information Architecture detail.
</p>

Before diving into the wireframes, we mapped out the high-level [information architecture](https://github.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/blob/master/_docs_readme/arquitectura-info.jpg) to make sure the whole team was on board about the app‚Äôs structure.

## Step 6 ‚Äî Sketching and Wireframing

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/sketches.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs sketches" width="1000">
First Sketches.
</p>

After identifying the key user flow and information architecture, we did some rough sketching and worked on low-fidelity wireframes to **quickly generate ideas on how the main screens could fit together and figure out the details of the interface elements.**

Applying lean UX, our team sketched wireframes to readily test, validate, and move on to digital wireframes.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/wireframes_01.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs wireframes" width="1000">
Wireframes.
</p>

Each team member worked on their own wireframes using Balsamiq Mockups. We then revised every proposal and picked the best ideas and solutions that came up.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/wireframes_02.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs wireframes" width="1000">
Wireframes.
</p>

We settled on a **linear navigation for the incident report, that progressively asks for the user‚Äôs input, in 4 easy steps:**

* Pick a category;
* Describe the incident;
* Add a photo (optional; up to 4);
* Set the incident‚Äôs location (automatically filled-in by the device‚Äôs GPS but can be changed, as the user might want to submit an incident later);
* Revise and report;

All screens from the report user flow have a top bar showing the user‚Äôs progress and the number of steps until completion. The progress bar also serves as a navigation that enables the user to go back and fix any mistakes he might have done while filling-in the report‚Äôs details.

## Step 7 ‚Äî Mockups

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/mockups_01.jpg" alt="Sketch document showing a couple of Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs app screens" width="1000">
</p>

I designed high-fidelity mockups to establish the look and feel of our MVP and fine-tune all the visual details.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/mockups_02.jpg" alt="Home, Neighbourhood, Profile, Help and Issue detail screens" width="1000">
Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs main tabs ‚Äî Home, Neighbourhood, Profile, Help ‚Äî and Issue detail screens.
</p>

The reporting process is simple, straightforward, and can be finished in 4 easy steps plus confirmation.

Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs screens for submitting an issue.
</p>

I also worked on a friendly onboarding that clearly explains the benefits of our product and shows how Toqcidad√£o can make our users‚Äô lives easier.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/mockups_onboarding.jpg" alt="Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs register, onboarding and home screens" width="1000">
Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs onboarding.
</p>

Making sure they feel familiar with what to expect before using the app will hopefully ease our users into the product‚Äôs experience, setting them up for success, as well as reduce drop off rate and improve retention. üëç

## Step 8 ‚Äî Prototyping and Usability Testing

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/testing_prototype.jpg" alt="Browser showing the prototype being built with InVision" width="1000">
Prototyping...
</p>

I uploaded the mockups to InVision and made a [clickable prototype]( https://filipago.github.io/toqcidadao-app-prototype) to emulate the app‚Äôs behaviour and **set up a basis to test the product** (this links to our last prototype version, with improvements and fixes).

> Keep it simple, so you‚Äôll keep doing it.</br>
> Steve Krug, _Don‚Äôt Make Me Think, Revisited_

User testing was **vital to getting feedback for our design solution and understanding if the app was clearly understood**, working well and usable by our potential end users.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/testing_intro.jpg" alt="What we told our test participants: We are developing an app called Toqcidad√£o that aims to improve the way citizens report issues they come across in their neighbourhood. The following test is fairly simple but remember: we‚Äôre testing the app, not you! We just want to know what we can improve so don‚Äòt worry, there are no right or wrong answers. We would like you to complete a set of two tasks while thinking aloud and explaining your actions. This can help us a lot because it enables us to pinpoint where users like you might experience more difficulties while using the app." width="1000">
User testing intro to make sure our participants felt comfortable and relaxed.
</p>

We did **multiple rounds of user testing, with a set of 2 scenarios**, that allowed us to determine if our users could effectively perform the most routine task ‚Äî reporting an issue:

**1st Scenario:**</br>
_You found an abandoned couch on the street. Using Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs app, report the issue to local authorities. Don‚Äôt forget to add a photo!_

**2nd Scenario:**</br>
_You found an abandoned couch on the street, but you didn‚Äôt have the time to report the issue at the scene. You‚Äôre currently at home and want to report it. Using Toqcidad√£o‚Äôs app, report the issue to local authorities. Don‚Äôt forget to change the issue‚Äôs location!_

**We ran usability tests through direct interviews (‚âà 10 minutes each) over 2 days, with a panel of 11 potential users**, using the clickable prototype.
<br></br>

**#** | **Age** | **Gender** | **Kids** | **Education** | **Job**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
 **1** | 61 | F | Yes | College | IT Specialist
 **2** | 61 | M | Yes | College | IT Specialist
 **3** | 48 | F | Yes | High School | Office Clerk
 **4** | 25 | F | No | High School | Student
 **5**| 52 | F | Yes | College | Senior Technician

 **11** | 40 | M | No | College | Software Engineer
<p align="center">
Demographic characterization of the participants. The sample was significant and adequately represented the potential users‚Äô population.
</p>

We recorded all the interviews, following the express authorization of the interviewees (documented in the interview itself and on paper, before recordings began).

We took note of every issue, comment and relevant insight, and **iterated on the draft product based on user feedback.**

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FilipaGo/toqcidadao-app-prototype/master/_images_readme/testing_screens_nav.jpg" alt="Top navigation iteration" width="1000">
Before and after images of the top navigation/progress bar (report screens).
</p>

After each test, we always tried to collect more information on what people liked the most, what they disliked, whether the product had met their expectations and improvement recommendations.

Most participants weren‚Äôt familiar with this type of product (probably due to its very low existence and dissemination in Portugal) but overall, they thought the app was quite useful, clear and easy to use.

**All participants successfully accomplished both scenarios** with fair ease and speed, which shows the mvp‚Äôs good usability level.

During testing, our users pinpointed the following **strengths**:

* Very intuitive user interface;
* Fundamentally visual interface;
* Fluid, well-structured app;
* The user quickly reaches his final goal (report an issue);
* The app can improve the user‚Äôs life quality (no more queues and filling long forms);
* The app completely fulfils its intended purpose.

<p align="center">

Success screen before and after images.
</p>

But the tests also helped us identify a few **problems** like:

* There is no way to know where the report was sent to; _fixed_
* There is no feedback on the outcome of the issue report; _fixed_
* Icons can be hard to perceive, especially in the navigation bar; _improved the iconography and added labels_
* The report summary was unclear for some participants; _to be fixed_
* Some users would like to receive an email confirmation when submitting an issue; _to think about later_
* Location editing is not intuitive; _improved_
* Too much text on the help screen; _to be fixed_
* More categories; _to be fixed_
* ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt like writing‚Äù. _we‚Äôll have to think about this one later on_ ü§î

Change issue location before and after images.
</p>

Our users also left us with a set of relevant recommendations and **suggestions** to be taken into account in future releases:

* Extend categorization to areas of the private sphere (where public suppliers intervene, like ‚ÄúUtilities‚Äô failures‚Äù);
* Improve the way monitoring the issues‚Äô resolution is performed;
* Create a category explicitly related to animal protection;
* Create a category for non-typified issues;
* Create subcategories (like litter);
* Show the authority that receives the issue report on the Success screen ‚Äî ‚ÄúYour report was submitted to authority x‚Äù. _fixed in the MVP_

## Final Thoughts

Overall, the tests went smoothly but naturally, the authorities‚Äô response to the reported issues will decide the success of our product.

Part of the minor difficulties experienced by the participants during tests was due to some shortcomings in the initial prototype and not exactly user interface problems.

**Implementing part of our users‚Äô recommendations can bring significant value to our product**, possibly with extra costs that may be marginal in terms of design and development.

### Next Steps

**Priority ‚Äúfixes‚Äù:**

* Rework the help screen copy and layout;
* Rework the report summary layout;
* Work on a more comprehensive categorization, like animal protection and noise;
* More in-depth testing of the categories with tree testing and card sorting.

Even though the following **improvements** don‚Äôt fully impact our mission, they align with our vision and would be nice to have:

* Voice-activated reporting;
* Make the product usable without a mandatory registry, even though some functionalities will still require it;
* Deliver local alerts like construction work, public transportation suppressions, strikes, venues‚Äô closure, town meetings, etc..;
* Provide local council and service providers‚Äô contacts and information;
* Connect with nearby council and service providers via social media;
* Provide local contacts for emergencies (like police and fire stations);
* Provide local useful contacts like pharmacies, train stations, etc‚Ä¶;
* Display nearby events.
